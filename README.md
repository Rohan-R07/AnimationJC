# ‚ú® Jetpack Compose Animation Showcase

This is a practice/demo Android app built with **Jetpack Compose** to explore and demonstrate a wide range of animation APIs and text motion techniques. The goal is to visualize how various animations work in Compose and understand how they can be applied to real UI development.

---

## üéØ Purpose

This app is designed to help practice and understand the most commonly used **Jetpack Compose animations**, including animated UI components and animated text behaviors. It can serve as a **reference** or inspiration for other developers learning Compose.

---

## üöÄ Features

- ‚úÖ Multiple types of animations demonstrated:
  - `animateDpAsState`
  - `animateIntAsState`
  - `animateColorAsState`
  - `updateTransition`
  - `infiniteTransition`
  - `AnimatedVisibility`
  - `AnimatedContent`
  

- üåÄ Animated splash screen:
  - Uses `LaunchedEffect` to trigger the animation and delay
  - Navigates via `Navigation 3` (Compose's newest version of compose navigation)

- üîÅ Repetitive animations with `repeatable`, `RepeatMode.Reverse`

- üéØ Animation Specs Used:
  - `tween`
  - `spring`
  - Various easing functions (like `EaseInOutCubic` etc...)

- üß† State Management:
  - Compose state patterns (`remember`, `mutableStateOf`)
  - ViewModel-free design for simplicity
  - Controlled visibility and transitions

- ‚úçÔ∏è Text Animation Examples:
  - Smooth `AnimatedBox` with color or size changes
  - `MovingText` using `animateOffsetAsState`
  - AnimatedChanging Content via `AnimatedContent`
